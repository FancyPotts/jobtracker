# jobtracker

Personal project to increase the likelihood of landing a job by tracking the jobs applied for. Web scraper to be built later.

The front end will be using the typical HTML/CSS/JS.

The backend will utilize Python.

This will be a deep-dive opportunity to build a full stack application, and if it can increase landing the job by even an iota, it's better than before. 

This is a placeholder that's intended to remind myself.
